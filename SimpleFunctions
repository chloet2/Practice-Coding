def max(x,y):   #First define the function by giving it a variable name. 
    if x >= y:      #Now define the piece of cody (the body) that you want to store in this function. 
        return x
    else:
        return y

z = max(5, 10)  #Now use the function by setting a variable and calling it. 
print(z)        #Print the function.
