A simple program to show how to write a FOR loop. 

friends = ['Joseph','Glen','Sally']   #First, set a list of items. 
for friend in friends:                #use FOR and set the first iteration. 
    print('Happy birthday', friend)   #set the PRINT function to iterate through the FOR loop. 
print('Done!')                        #set the final PRINT function outside of the loop to give the user a sign that the loop has finished.

Result:

Happy birthday Joseph
Happy birthday Glen
Happy birthday Sally
Done!
